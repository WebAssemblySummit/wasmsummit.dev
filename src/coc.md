# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct governs this repo, the organizers and organizers' communication
channels, as well as the event.

We draw heavily from the [RustConf Code of Conduct](https://rustconf.com/about/#code-of-conduct), and the [CascadiaJS 2020 Code of Conduct](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/coc).

## WebAssembly Summit is intended to be an inclusive, welcoming conference for everyone.

In particular, we do not tolerate harassment of conference participants or organizers in any form. Conference participants and organizers violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## Who does the Code of Conduct apply to?

Everyone - including attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers - is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind is not tolerated. Organizers will enforce this code with any event involvement, including, but not limited to: online engagement (Twitter/Discord), or any WebAssembly Summit hosted event.

## What constitutes a Code of Conduct violation?

Harassment, including disparaging verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants and organizers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant or organizer engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

## Repoting Code of Conduct Issues
