# What is WebAssembly Summit?

WebAssembly Summit is a conference to bring together the WebAssembly community to discuss and share new and interesting ideas in WebAssembly!

# When is WebAssembly Summit 2021?

April-ish 2021

# How will WebAssembly Summit 2021 be hosted?

Due to current events with the Covid-19 Pandemic, WebAssembly Summit 2021 will be virtual! The event will be happening online in two forms: Youtube for the talks and Discord for communication.

## Youtube

Our plan is to have spoken speakers pre-record talks, with them being livestreamed during the time of the event on our [WebAssemblySummit Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9PqDCdacsTpyRaIryhA8g). We will have live MC-ing before and in-between the talks.

## Discord

We will be using Discord for communication to share announcements for the event, and for attendees to chat with one another. We will have channels for communicating during the broadcast of the Youtube livestream, as well as seperate channel topics for more focused discussions.

We are also hoping to have "Fireside chats", which will be sessions hosted by selected speakers to do a deep dive or discussion into specific WebAssembly topics.

# Can I speak at WebAssembly Summit 2021?

_Everyone_ is invited to apply to speak at WebAssembly Summit 2021. The application deadline is January 15th, 2021.

# Do you have a code of conduct?

WebAssembly Summit is intended an inclusive conference for everyone and will enforce our [code of conduct](https://github.com/WebAssemblySummit/webassembly-summit.org/blob/68e669d279ece17af2466534096f71094034ea60/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make sure everybody feels welcome and safe.

This code of conduct is subject to change to match our virtual attendence for Wasm Summit 2021. Especially with things in accordance of online communication, both in the WebAssembly Summit Discord, and outside as well.

# Will you record the talks?

Yes, the talks will be uploaded on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9PqDCdacsTpyRaIryhA8g). So no worries, even if you cannot attend or follow the livestream, you will be able to catch up on the talks later once they are published.
