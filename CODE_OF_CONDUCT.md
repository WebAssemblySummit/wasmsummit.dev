# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct governs this repo, the organizers and organizers' communication
channels, as well as the event.

We draw heavily from the [RustConf Code of Conduct](https://rustconf.com/about/#code-of-conduct).

## WebAssembly Summit is intended to be an inclusive, welcoming conference for everyone. 

In particular, we do not tolerate harassment of conference participants or organizers in any form. Conference participants and organizers violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes disparaging verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants and organizers asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant or organizer engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. 

On-site, conference staff will be identifiable by their Wasm purple tshirts. If you need help of any kind, to report a bad situation, or anything else not specified that we can help with, please find us on site, DM us on twitter, or call/text.
